# Classifying Tumors in Mammograms

## Problem Statement

Breast Cancer is the second leading cause of death in women around the globe. Early detection through routine mammograms is the best prevention in improving Breast Cancer outcomes. 

For this project, we used 2 different mammogram datasets of differing sizes and built various neural network models in order to classify Tumors vs. No Tumors in mammogram images. Manual visual analysis of these images can be time consuming and subjective. This model aims to be used as a supplementary detection method for use by radiologists and oncologists.
